# Eu-WLB-Prediction
This repository contains code and data used in the thesis titled "European Work-Life Equilibrium, A Predictive Analysis Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques". The project investigates the prediction of work-life balance (WLB) in European populations using machine learning algorithms.
**Focus**: Predicting WLB with LightGBM, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
**Data**: European Social Survey (ESS) with 54,627 entries and 30+ features across demographics, social aspects, work organization, family life, and personal characteristics.
